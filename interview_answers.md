# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

A functional (stateless) component does not manage its own state and is not able to keep track of changing data. A functional component often relies on props.
A stateful component has state and is able to keep track of changing data. A stateful component is also able to use props.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

The `componentWillMount` function is called before the render method is executed.
The `componentWillUpdate` function is called as soon as the `shouldComponentUpdate` returns true. Any state changes via `this.setState` are not allowed as this method should be strictly used to prepare for an upcoming update, not trigger an update itself.

3. Define stateful logic.

Stateful logic is any code that is used to manipulate or create data. It's a way to drive and manipulate data that is separate from the display of that data in your application. For example: adding a product, editing a product, deleting a product, etc.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?

(1) Arrange: render the component you are testing
(2) Act: find the specific element you are targeting
(3) Assert: pass the test if the element exists in the component (or whatever else you are testing)
